Infrastructure as code
------------------------------------------------------------------
Infrastructure as code is one of the main and important part of an devops journey 
as by the name in this one you will be managing and configuration infrastucture through some processes and steps 

so what is configuring ...it is a process or otherwise it will be called as configuration management is nothing but you will be taking care 
of your computers servers and software to perform well as you want 

provisioning is also one of the most important words it may be giving out the
certain resources .It may be seems to be same but after provisioning  only configuration 
will be taking place .let us take an example such that you are buying an apple that is called as provisionig 
and peeling it and making it comfortable to eat is the configuration 

there are many tools that will do infrastructure as code

1.chef 

2.puppet
 
3.ansible 

4.terraform 

but ansible and terraform are the two important tools but there are some difference 
between the anible and terraform 

Both ansible and terraaform are doing the same but there are some difference in some parts such that
terraform is so importantly for mainly most focuses on infrastructure provisioning tools and ansible is 
the one in which it is mainly focussed on configuratiion as tool 


like the same way ansible and puppet chef are also most compared where ansible uses the simple 
yaml file but puppet and chef uses ruby on rails which is more difficult when learning
