In the before page i would have mentinoned about the IAC that is infrastructure as code 
but i would have compared som eof the tools .I compared it because you should be knowing the difference between them 
only but not to tell them which is the best .You should be able to adapt to the tool 
which your organisation is suggesting 

OBSERVABILITY
---------------------------------------------------------------

Observability is one of the concepts or it can be a part of the whole devops process and when you come into the world 
of observability you may also be coming across one word named monitoring 

at the first you  may think there is no difference and both are same but there is the difference to put 
simply monitoring helps you to find or identify problems but observability helps you to resolve the problems that was identified by 
monitoring 

1.promethus

dashboard 

Thanos will also be used for the same observability may be in a larger scale
