k3's vs k8's
--------------------------------------------------------------------

first we need to know what is k8's ......kubernetes there are 8 letters between the k and s in the word  
so they call it has k8's.k8's is the short form of kubernetes

then what is k3's

k3 is nothing but the small version of the kubernetes a small and slim down thing but has the same functionality 
as the k8's .if you know about linnux operating system then you can easily relate this .
In linux operating sysytem there will be many distributions present for one operating system itself 
like wise k3 is a sub division of k8 with same functionality 

It is packaged into single binary ,100 megabytes or less than that ..in which the it has single conto plane 
and it will act as both control plane and worker node as well .so thats why some people will be using this
