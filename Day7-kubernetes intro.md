kubernetes 
--------------------------------------------------------------------------
As you guys already know about docker and how it worls in the previous post Now 
we're gonna look about one of the closely related technology that is connnected to docker that is 
Kubernetes

Kubernetes may be considered as an orchestration tool or platform that is used to control or
makes the best practices and how to use the containers 

kubernetes is not only  an orchestration tool but is more dhan that
kubernetes was initally found in google and they have using them in different name 

Then they have made them open source and put it in gsoc i think like chromium etc 

The main architecture of kubernetes can be divide into two main important parts 

                  1.master node 
                  
                  2.worker node 

I literally dont think it is good naming convention and eventhough kunal kushwaha called it in some other name 

I am going to consider them as 
                  master node - community 
                  worker node - friends  

this is the introduction to kubernetes later on we will dive deep into kubernetes architecture 
until then bye 

Thankyou
