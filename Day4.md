------------------------------------------------------------------------
Now we will be straight away going into the pre-requisities and then important technologies such as docker,kubernetes,ansible etc 

1.The main immportant pre requisite is that LINUX operating system .Im beginner to the linux I have to study it from the begining so it was little bit tough .I have choosen 
the "Introduction to the linux" by linux foundation .It is like directly learning about the project from who have created it .

The linux foundation gave indepth explanation to all the terms that are present in them from choosing which family systems for your use and how it got orginated more
about kernel, basic commands ,file systems how are the files are distributed and placed inside them etc,
In linnux itself you can able to download the files ,we can find route ,what is shell scripting and its basics,what is sudo 
etc many more things that i have understood in this course "handson must for implemneting the basic commands"

2.Networking is the main and also important pre requisite that you must be knowing ...in devops we wil be using many technologiess for them networkijng is the main
and important knowledege you shouldd have acquired .ayous should be knowing how internet works what is the role of internet service provide ,http,tcp/ip layers ,IP address,IPv4,IPv6
etc these are the main importaant thing that you must be knowing

3. GO programming language is the main programming language used in devops and also they will be using little bit of python 
If you have stron knowledge in any one of the language means then it will be a cake walk for you the functionalities will be same but syntax might be different
