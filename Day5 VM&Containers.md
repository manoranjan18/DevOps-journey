hey guys today we are going to know about virtual machines and containers

virtual machines :
---------------------------------------------------------

 Virtual machinnes are nothing but in which you can able to run multiple Os on your machinesa and you can also
multiple appications on top of the OS

1.In virtual machines it will be allocating specific amount of hardwares which are used in to run the 
os 
2.for example if you have the computer of windows means then by using virtual machines you can be able to run ubuntu 
you can able to run macos etc 
3.In the ubuntu you can able to run multiple applicationns and in mac OS you can able to run multiple 
applications and as well as in windows 
4.Your computer;s whole hardware and other specs will be divided according to the needs of the OS 

Containers:
----------------------------------------------------------------------
Thecontainer is  little bit different from the VM 

The conntainer is nothing but you can containersied the applicatio you want and also
you can place it in isolated environment and also it will run on any OS you have .If you have 
windows also it will be running and also in mac os also it will be running 

1.It straight away neglects the difficulties of using and installing multiple os 

2.In container it is always in a well structured manner and you dont want to install any other files etc

3.It is most useful in thw way of microservices
