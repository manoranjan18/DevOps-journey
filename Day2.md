Hey guys its my second day ! and going forward 


In today's learning what we're going to learn is that what is the software development world without devops and how devops will change some process and it will 
help the software process to do things in a quicker way

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

SOFTWARE DEVELOPMENT WORLD 

Every Organisation will be using Agile model to build software there are many models but agile is the 
most efficient one 

In Agile the whole software developing process will be divivded into iterations and will be using scrum also

The iterations are nothing but small process with small functionality 

The main thing is that let me take application is of 10 marks and in agile technology organisation will be getting the 5 teams and they will assign the work of 
2 marks for each team 

The ideology is that people will work faster when you give them small things or small projects like [5*2=10]

There sre some software that was built to use agile model efficiently like JIRA

ok that how software development world will works with testing quality assurance deployment review and feedback

-----------------------------------------------

DevOps & Agile :

Now the Beast comes into the picture .

We know that The Agile works based on the integrations and the devops has some technology which uses or which spees up the intergration process 
automated speed and in very efficient manner.The automation plays an very important role  

In DevOps it usus the term CI/CD which means continuous integration and continuous development or deployment 

so combining agile and devops is the most imaportant and intelligent process for any organisation as well as it will improve the communicatin between them .
the technologies used for CI/CD are jenkins etc,

In future we will be seeing more about devops and CI/CD
