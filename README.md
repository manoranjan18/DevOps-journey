# DevOps-journey

Hi there everyone .I'M S.V.Mano Ranjan who is an devops enthusiast and wanted to achieve more in the devops technology who alsp knows html,css,js also .I have recently completed Google's -UX Design course on coursera where I Have learnt about how to  create a website which should be inclusive to all and also knows to create wire frame and prototypes in figma .Enough of me.

This repository is mainly focussing on how and what I'm doin in the devops technology and also formulating something in my own style itself

The motivation and idea of this "DevOps as an career" came from three important people as far as in  my view
                                 
                                    -kunal Kushwaha 
                                    -Tech with Nana
                                    -kubesimplify-Saiyam pathak
                                    
 These are the people who taught me what is devops and what is DevOps as an career
 
 These three people have seperate kond of roadmap and seperate kind of teaching as well .so if also want to start your journey in devops as an career means you can follow any one of them or you can choose who ever you want because there are plenty of people plenty of choices and plenty of resources  
  
I have followed "kubesimplify Roadmap2022"&"Kunal kushwaha's devops playlist"
  
The main thing I have learnt from following the road map is that eventhough you have watched their videos and the hands onalso you will not be satisfied and you cannot movng forward with the same speed and with the same energy as you have started your journey 
  
In My point of view "The knowledge you're giving out should be greater then knowledge you're consuming"
 
you should be giving out knowledge in any part such as 
   
                        -blogs 
                        -youtube videos 
                        -podcast etc 
   


If you're a very good writer means you can write your blogs on -hashnode, medium 
If you're very good in creating videos means you can create videos in youtube 
If you're a very good speaker means you can create the podcast -spotify podcasts ,google podcast

I am more inspired to write like these pages in github so I'm choosing this 
I am also inspired from 90daysofDevops repository 

so here I am you can also start your own journey make it fun and interesting .

It will be hard everything will be new but dont leave the consistency behind you.
