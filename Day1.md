So guys let me take you to the beginning of the devops or you can shortly this as the some points to be known before jumping into the devops

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

lets come into the main point that is what is devops and what is this job and what is this name 

1.DevOps =Development + Operation 

2.your job as an devops engineer is that you will act as an bridge between development team and operational; team 

3.Some researchers and scientist of Einstein Era said that "You know what it is not the job man basically its a theory man no one can work on this "

4.But as of today DevOps is definitely a job and even companies are hiring  people even with no job experience itself 

5.The scope of this job is as high it can get and it is as tough as it can get 

6.You will get a average pay as an remote engineer in north america or Europe as an devops engineer is around 70-100,000 U.S.Dollars 

7.Workhard Dont leave your consistency behind 

--------------------------------------------------------------------------------

EXAMPLE:

lets take youre working in an organisation and they re building an application  X

team A-development   team B-operational 

once team A developed the application say website means then they will be sending it to team B for operational and also for the deployment 

what will happen is that operational team will find a bug or an error hat the development team cannot be able to solve and the develop-ment team finds an erro while using that operational team cannot able to solve it 

they both dont work in rythm and they both dont have the same mindset and they both do the blame game 

In the organisation point of view they cant get the work in a fast and steady manner 

so they needed  people who work in the middle of them and who knows both the working and the operation procedurs and techniques 

"JACK OF TRADE ACE OF NONE"

They will be also working with some devops tools as well 

From the organisation point of view the devops engineer should be able to manage the connection between the two and to fast track the output of the application in a well mannered way 

thats all for today. 

I have the thought personally that you should be doing your ground work so that you can pick up the mentor or you can pick up the best people you like in the devops or any other field
