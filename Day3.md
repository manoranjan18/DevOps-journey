CI/CD -pipeline 
-------------------------------------------------------
hi guys you would have  found the above writings interesting and I'm assuming in that way; now moving on to the next one

Now we're going to see on next important topics .Yesterday you may have noticed that I have told you that
Devops will co-work with agile int the iteration part .So we're going to fid out what really means 

On that case the main important thing is that CI/CD pipeline

CI/CD -means continuous integration and continuous deployment 

pipeline -the word pipeline generally means the stream of process or you can imagine as the real pipeline in whichsome process
of integration and deployment will be present 

------------------------------------------------------------------
There are some important process in the devops world such as plan ,code&build,testing ,release,deploy,operate ,monitor

when you look at the process you may be familiar with some of the terms such as plan code build .
plan is nothing but the blueprint or a set of process needed to execute the idea,code means you will dicuss about what are 
the services needed and started to code,build is nothing but getting into a whole thing code +services

Then you will be releasing the project based on your company needs and now comes the main part is that you will ned to operate 
the application in sometimes you may be needing to increase the servers networks based on the customer needs
and you will be monitoring whole application whether everything is going on correctly or not

Now the Automation and continuous process will be happening and devops technology will come into place such that you will be seamlessly and efficinetly dong everything 

CI -continuous integration ,in this process you will be building ,testing,merging the bugs 
found 

CD-continuous Delivery means that automatically releasing the bug fixed code into the repository or the place 
where it has to be in and then it will be released to production

CD-Continuous Deployment is the one in which it will be automatically deployed to production

This is what i have learnt today the upcoming days will be so much interesting guys 
we will be studying the most important pre requisites before entering into devops techology
